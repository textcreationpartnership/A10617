            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt by not imputing Sinne, therefore ſaith the Lord to his people, <hi>I have put away thy Tranſgreſsions like a Cloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 42.22. Heb. 10.17. Rom. 8.1</note> 
               <hi>and thy Sinnes as a Miſt,</hi> that is, in reſpect of imputation: So that to theſe there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore, ſaith <hi>David, Bleſſed is the man, to whom the Lord imputeth not Sinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> Againe, he healeth our ſinne by quenching the inherent flame thereof by the force of his Holy Spirit: for it is the operation of Gods Spirit to beat downe ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> to mortifie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to renew in us the Image of God. Thus wee ſee,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.24.</note> that it is God that healeth ſinne, as the efficient and principall Agent: Therfore to him let us ſeeke, of him let us deſire the pardon and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes, of him let us intreat for the force of his Holy Spirit, to quench the flame of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Corruption, bidding a farewell to all Romiſh ſuperſtitions, indulgences, ſatisfactions and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Saints, for our God is a iealous God, and will not give his Glory to another.</p>
            <p>Againe, as it is proper unto God alone to heale Sinne, ſo hee is moſt ready to performe that Cure,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:712:5"/>
which is, the ſecond point to bee conſidered. No ſooner did <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſubmit himſelfe, and intreat the pardon of iniquitie, but preſently the Lord replies, <hi>I will heale their Rebellions;</hi> plainly witneſsing that he is not wanting to us, if wee be not wanting to our ſelves: but if wee acknowledge our miſerie, and moure for our tranſgreſsion, he is moſt ready to cure us: Oh how frequent are examples in this kinde! When <hi>David</hi> from his mourning ſoule did cry out,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.15.</note> 
               <hi>peccavi,</hi> I haue ſinned, preſently God had his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ready to ſpeake comfort to his ſoule, <hi>Thy Sinne is put away.</hi> When that Luxurious ſonne, that had prodigally ſpent his portion,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> did but once cry out, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to bee called thy Sonne,</hi> preſently his loving Father did runne to meet him, hee did embrace him in his armes, hee did kiſſe him with the kiſſes of his mouth, and gave him royall entertainement. Alas,<note place="margin">Luk. 7.38.</note> when deepe wandring <hi>Mary</hi> had the feeling of her Miſery, that ſhee came and ſtood at the feet of CHRIST, wept and mourned for her tranſgreſsion, oh how ſoone were the gates of Mercy opened unto her; how ſoone did ſhee heare a comfortable abſolution? Oh that then wee would bee cautions, that wee be not wanting to our ſelves by the hardneſſe of our hearts, refuſing this bleſſed Cure:<note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> we haue Chriſt Ieſus crying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us with ſweet and familiar termes, <hi>Open unto mee, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> Hee tells us, that hee ſtands and knockes at the doore: If any man open unto him, hee will come unto him, and will ſupp with him. Oh that then wee would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to open our hearts to entertaine this heavenly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:712:6"/>
Phyſitian, that hee might heale and cure the deepe corruptions of them, leſt whilſt wee keepe faſt the doore of our hearts, at length the doore of mercie bee ſhut againſt us, and wee periſh in the loathſome deſeaſe of our ſinne and wickedneſſe: And ſo much briefly for the perſon, emphatically ſet forth in the pronoune <hi>Ego,</hi> I; <hi>I will heale their Rebellions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now unto the Action, expreſt in the word <hi>heale;</hi> by which Metaphoricall ſpeech is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that ſinne is a deſeaſe: for as there are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall Maladies that doe affect the body, ſo there are ſpirituall Maladies that doe affect the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to inſiſt upon this Metaphor, and the more cleerly to ſhew, that ſinne is a deſeaſe, even a furious and a grievous deſeaſe, that doth in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner oppreſſe, contaminate and infect the ſoule; we may fitly compare it to a Fever, to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, to a Phrenſie, to a Lethargie. And firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fever, and that in a fivefold reſpect; firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of debilitation: for as a Fever doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully debilitate and weaken the body, making it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to performe any validious exerciſe, ſo dealeth ſinne with the ſoule, it ſo weakens it that it becoms unable to performe any holy duty,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.18.</note> any fit action pleaſing in the ſight of God: for what ſaith <hi>Salomon? The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhominable unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> all he doth is odious in his ſight: for, as the author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> But where ſinne hath plenall dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there ſauing faith hath no impreſsion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followes, that all that theſe doe, is utterly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaſing unto God. Thus firſt ſinne is fitly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto a Fever in reſpect of debilitation, it ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:712:6"/>
the ſoule, that it makes it unable to doe any thing that is ſavorie in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſinne is fitly compared unto a Fever <hi>propter guſtum,</hi> in reſpect of taſt: for as to him that is affected with a vehement Fever the moſt ſweeteſt things become bitter and diſtaſtfull, ſo is it where the ſoule is laden with impiety,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note> there the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pleaſant things (that which <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes was ſweeter to him than hony and the hony combe) becomes moſt ſharp and unſavory. What could bee more ſweet than Chriſts moſt heavenly ſpeech delivered in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.53, 54.</note> 
               <hi>Except yee eate my fleſh and drinke my bloud, yee have no life in you. Whoſoever eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> Oh what could bee more ſweet than this heavenly voice? but what could bee more harſh,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.60.</note> or more diſtaſtfull to the ſoule-ſick carnall Capernaites? therfore they cry out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: oh this is a hard ſpeech, who is able to heare it? Againe what could be more ſweet than our Saviours bleſſed ſpeech to that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinfull woman,<note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> pronouncing to her a moſt comfortable abſolution, <hi>Thy ſinnes be forgiven thee?</hi> yet what could bee more diſpleaſing to the arrogant Phariſees?<note place="margin">Luke 7.49.</note> therefore they murmured among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Who is this, that even forgiveth ſinnes?</hi> Thus ſecondly ſinne may fitly bee compared to a Fever <hi>propter guſtum,</hi> in reſpect of taſt: for it makes the ſweeteſt and moſt ſavorie nutritives, to ſeem as if they were moſt ſharp and violent diſtructives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſinne is fitly compared to a Fever, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of digeſtion: for as the fierce inflaming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie doth ſo oppreſſe the ſtomack, that it diſables it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:712:7"/>
to admit digeſtion to the moſt wholſome food, but oft makes it become ſo loathſome to it, that it doth <hi>evomere,</hi> ſend it forth againe; ſo dealeth ſinne with the ſoule, it diſables it to admit digeſtion to the moſt heavenly things, but makes them ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to it, that it ſuffers it not to poſſeſſe ſo much as any quiet impreſsion: Hence it was, that though <hi>Noah</hi> ſpake to the old world to returne from their impieties,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> or elſe the Lord would deſtroy them by a generall deluge from off the face of the earth: though he did build the Arke in their ſight, to ſhew the certainty of this iudgement, unleſſe they would revert, and continued this admonition by the ſpace of a hundred and twenty yeeres; yet behold their miſerable ſtate, they admit it no digeſtion, but did as it were <hi>evomere,</hi> ſend it forth againe: for their ſoules were full of ſinne, the imaginations of their heart even altogether wicked.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.14.</note> Though <hi>Lott</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the voice of God to the wicked Sodomites, that they ſhould depart from that pernitious citie, for God would deſtroy it: alas, they held it ridiculous, they admit it no digeſtion, for their ſoules were full of ſinne.<note place="margin">Exod. 5.1.</note> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the expreſſe word of God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he ſhould let his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple goe, and free them from their grievous captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: alas, his ſtomack would not beare it, hee would give it no paſſage, but twas loathſome unto him. therefore hee replied,<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould heare his voyce? what, is there any that can command me? any, to whom my Scepter ſhould ſtoup?</hi> for his ſoule was full gorged with horrid ſinnes. So though the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 18.11.</note> did plainly witneſſe againſt the wicked ones of thoſe times, that he had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:712:7"/>
prepared a plague for them, that hee had purpoſed a thing againſt them, and therefore invited them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from their ſiniſter waies, to prevent that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtroke of his iuſtice: alas, they would none of it, they admit it no digeſtion, but returne it up again,<note place="margin">Ier. 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> deſperately anſwering, <hi>Wee will walke after our owne imaginations, wee will doe every man after the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe of his wicked heart,</hi> for their ſoules were full of ſinne. So our bleſſed Saviour gave that yongue Man in <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell a ſpeciall Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, to revive his dying ſpirits,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.21.</note> to cure that great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, the Philarguria of his ſoule, but oh the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that fearfull ſinne, it ſuffers it not to worke upon him, it ſends it up againe: alas, he went away ſorrowing.<note place="margin">Mat. 19.22.</note> Faine hee would have retayned Chriſts bleſſed potion, but the ſtrength of his diſeaſe would not admit it; therefore he bids a farewell to Chriſt Ieſus. Thus thirdly ſinne is fitly compared to a fever. It takes away the ſtomack of the ſoule, and makes it unable to digeſt the moſt wholſome things.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſin is fitly compared to a Fever <hi>propter inflammationem,</hi> in reſpect of fierce and violent infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: for as that virulent Maladie burnes, and with its unnaturall heat torments all the vitall and ſpirituall powers, ſo deales ſinne with the ſoule, for even oft in this life, it fearfully inflames it, burnes it, and fills it full of wrathfull horror: For although wicked and prophane perſons doe many times paſſe by the remembrance of their ſinnes, either by laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſcourſes, vaine ſocieties, diſſolute ſports or the deep habit of ſinne, for, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Bern Ser. 8. in Cant. Iſid. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> an evill habit doth harden, and, as <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſpeakes, makes us become even without ſenſe and feeling;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:712:8"/>
But what? oh, yet ſinne lieth at the doore, it waits opportunity to plunge the ſoule with fearfull miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> purſuing the conſcience as a ſwift hunting <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 10.9.</note> as a ſpeedy footed <hi>Nimſhi.</hi> There was a time when <hi>Cains</hi> conſcience had no feeling of that great ſinne of murder, which hee had committed, nay though God ſpake to him, and asked him, <hi>Where is thy brother?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.9.</note> which a man would thinke ſhould have made <hi>Cain,</hi> to have lookt downe upon his guilty conſcience, and to have ſtood amazed, ſhakt and trembled at this voyce: but alas, it ſtird him not at all, hee was ſtout, and ſtood as it were at defiance with God, as if he had done him the greateſt wrong that could be, ſo much as to inſinuate ſuch a matter with him: Therefore he inſolently replied, <hi>I cannot tell, am I my brothers keeper.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, I hope you will not lay his death to my charge, will you offer mee that indignity? So that here <hi>Cain</hi> was without all touch of conſcience, his great crying ſinne of murder troubled him not at all: but what? was this alwaies <hi>Cains</hi> ſtate? oh no, at length you may behold the fearfull fury of this ſinne, ſo flame up in his ſoule and conſcience, that the extreame burning heate thereof, did make him cry out, <hi>My ſinne is greater than can bee forgiven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> Strange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of late he ſaw no ſinne, it troubled him not at all; and now hee ſees ſo huge a burning flame, that hee thinkes all the ocean of Gods mercy is not able to quench it: therefore he cries out, <hi>My ſinne is greater than can bee forgiven.</hi> Againe, there was a time when treacherous <hi>Iudas</hi> had no taſt nor feeling of his wickedneſſe, he plotted and practiſed againſt his moſt innocent Maſter, he combined and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:712:8"/>
with the Scribes and Phariſees, Chriſts moſt cruell enemies, he concluded with them,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.14.</note> to betray him into their hands, and that for a meane and a baſe reward: and what?<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> was hee toucht for this ſinne? oh no, hee came into his maſters preſence with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and heard him openly divulge, One of you ſhall betray me:<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.21.</note> yet it ſtird him not at all, it wrought nothing upon his faſt claſped conſcience, but he was bold, and queſtioned his Maſter,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.25.</note> as if he had been as cleere a man as could be. Is it I, Maſter? As if he ſhould ſay, I hope, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of all the reſt, you will not thinke that I would doe ſuch a deed: what I betray you? I, your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, an Apoſtle, whom you have preferred to bee Treaſurer, and Keeper of your ſtore: what, I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you? my Maſter, my moſt loving Maſter, an innocent Lambe, a bleſſed Saviour? oh pray thinke not that I would do ſuch a deed. Nay though Chriſt anſwer him and tell him plainely, Thou haſt ſaid, oh <hi>Iudas,</hi> thou art the Man, how ſmoothly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſoever thou carrie it; yet it moved him not at all, all this while his conſcience was aſleepe, and ſo on it goes, <hi>Iudas</hi> takes his money, Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, he is condemned, he muſt dye. And what, ſtill aſleepe, <hi>Iudas?</hi> oh no, now the caſe begins to be altered; now his ſinne begins to rouſe him up; now it makes ſuch a fire in his ſoule, that he hath no reſt, but runs up and downe like a Mad man; now the treacherous hier, which was before more deare to him than his Maſters life, oh now he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, but up he takes it,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.3, 4.</note> and downe to the Prieſts and Elders hee goes, throwes it them againe, and cries out unto them, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying the

            <p>Thus we ſee ſinne is a deſeaſe; and therefore firſt in a fivefold reſpect fitly compared unto a Fever.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is fitly compared unto a Leproſie, in reſpect of infection, and that in a twofold kinde: for firſt, as that grievous maladie is of that nature, that it doth ſoone ſpread an infectious ſteame unto all thoſe that aſſociate themſelves with theſe,<note place="margin">

            <p>If therefore we will be the ſheepe of Chriſt, wee muſt heare his voyce humbly, truely and mournful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſsing our impieties: for, to brave out ſinne, or to lay ſome colour upon it, is to aggravate ſinne,

            <p>The Adulterer may alledge, it was luſt and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence that was the cauſe of his baſe wickedneſſe: the greedie inſatiable worldling that proſecutes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, and with the teeth of fraud, deceit, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie feeds upon living men; how eaſily may he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that he doth it to maintaine his reputation, to ſuſtaine his charge, to leave large revennues to his poſteritie?

Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.7.</note> ſhall inherite all things, all the joyes, all the comforts of Gods eternall kingdome. Therefore the ſheepe of Chriſt are induſtrious to heare the voyce of Chriſt, with true obedience, with readie hearts to doe that which the Lord impoſeth. The ſinnes of profits and the ſinnes of pleaſure, the Lord calls them from them, therefore they abandon them: the workes of pietie and remorſefull charitie, the Lord invites them unto them, and they willingly obey his heavenly voyce, eſteeming nothing ſo dear as obedience to this bleſſed Saviour, deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne themſelves wholly to his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; that as he ſaith unto them, <hi>Seeke ye my face,</hi> ſo their ſoules doe anſwer,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.8.</note> 
               <hi>Thy face Lord will we ſeeke,</hi> even in humble obedience all the dayes of our lives.</p>
            <p>For thoſe then who notwithſtanding any voyce of Chriſt, are pleaſed to make the world their God, and pleaſure to be their ſoules delight; for thoſe whom we may cleerly ſee by their baſe practices to be as alienate from Piety as prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> to be as remorſeleſſe as churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> to be as cruel as thoſe wicked ones in the eighth of <hi>Amos,</hi> that did long to have the new Moone paſt,<note place="margin">Amos. 8.5, 6.</note> and the Sabbath to bee gone, that they might grinde the faces of the poore, to ſell the diſtreſſed for ſilver, and the needy for ſhoe: in a word, for thoſe who make religion a cloke for their private fraudes and cunning oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for thoſe who content themſelves with a meere verball profeſsion, without any ſincere pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in converſation; oh know wee that theſe are none of the ſheepe of Chriſt: for his ſheepe doe heare his voyce obediently, endevouring to doe

whatſoever the Lord preſcribes. Nay, know wee that the wrath of God is imminent over theſe: for as obedience is a pleaſing ſacrifice, ſo diſobedience, oh tis diſpleaſing, and deeply provokes the wrath of God.

               <hi>Thou hast ſet our iniquities before thee, and our ſecret ſinnes in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Many places might bee alledged to like purpoſe, but theſe may be ſufficient to any ſober ſpirit, truly qualified with grace, to ſhew that Chriſt doth know his ſheep obſervatively, as marking all their ſteps and paſſages, even their ſinnes and their trangreſsions. As for that errour ſo familiarly divulged in theſe partes, that God can no waie ſee any ſinne in the juſtified perſon, it is more groſſe than the darkneſſe of Egypt, and worthy to be abhorred of all true chriſtian hearts: for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not (as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged)

a reall making of the creature righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if hee were righteous ſubjectively, and not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, for ſo to hold; is to hold a notable dreame of papiſme;<note place="margin">Faith the form of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therfore it is cleere that God ſeeth ſin in the juſtified notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doth often puniſh them for their ſinnes, as the Scriptures plainly witnes, that is, correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, though not vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. And whereas ſome are ſo nice that they will not have the afflictions that are impoſed upon Gods children to be called puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: herein they (at leaſt) much forget themſelves; for they ſeeke to pull away the <hi>genus</hi> from the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> for the word <hi>puniſh</hi> is the <hi>genus,</hi> and reſpects any affliction whatſoever: correction is the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate kinde, ſhewing it is a puniſhment for amendment, and to bring them to Chriſt. So in like maner <hi>revenge</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the puniſhment inflicted upon the pertinacious wicked, as proceeding wholly from the wrath of God againſt their ſinnes. Now it is a cleere rule that the <hi>genus</hi> and the <hi>ſpecies</hi> have a mutuall relation, that that which may be ſpoken of the one may be ſpoken of the other, and therefore the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impoſed upon Gods children may truly be called puniſhments. Nor doth this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or difference of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> take away or deſtroy the unitie of the <hi>genus,</hi> as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, for theſe rules are cleare, that <hi>diſtinctio ſpecierum non tollit unitatem generis:</hi> againe, <hi>perficitur genus determinations oppoſitarum, differentiarum.</hi>
               </note> Imputation being an externe act and out of us, in regard of the matter imputed, and is onely internall and within us, not materially, but formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as farre forth as it is apprehended by faith, and ſo applied unto the ſoule and conſcience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be a reall or materiall making (which is juſtification) but reputing of the creature righteous, which is our juſtification. And thus we ſee how firſt Chriſt may be ſaid to know his ſheepe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he knowes them preſervatively, and that internally, &amp; externally: Firſt internally to preſerve them from the fury and violence of ſinne; oh elſe how ſoone would ſinne extirpe and roote out all grace from their ſoules? but this bleſſed Saviour preſerves them, and keepes downe the violence of ſinne, continually nouriſhing in them faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Hence it comes, that though grievous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions do oft-times afflict the very ſheep of Chriſt yet their faith never totally failes, ſinnes never comes to have plenall domination: for, as the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> ſpeakes, the Lord hath written his lawes upon their hearts; and, as the ſame Prophet ſpeakes, hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:712:28"/>
ſo put his feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, that is, totally and altogether (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I ſhall more cleerely ſhew) wherefore the ſheepe of Chriſt may well ſay with bleſſed <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 23. The Lord is our Shepheard, he reſtoreth our ſoule, alas our ſliding ſoule, &amp; leades us in the paths of righteouſnes, even for his Names ſake. Thus firſt hee knows them preſervatively internally, to keep them from the fury of ſin. Secondly, he knows them preſervatively externally, to keep them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rage of Satan &amp; his wicked complices, who if they might be left unto their ſwinge, how ſoon would they root out the godly from the face of the earth? for (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) <hi>the wicked doth watch the righteous to ſlay him.</hi> Oh how did wicked <hi>Iezabell</hi> lye in waite to deſtroy the fervent zelous ſervant of God <hi>Eliah?</hi> how did cruell <hi>Saul</hi> plot and practiſe againſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>David?</hi> nay, the wicked and ungodly who love not each other, yet theſe (as we often ſee) can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to joyne hands together to conſpire a miſchiefe againſt the righteous:<note place="margin">Luke 23.12. <hi>Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 36 <hi>Conc.</hi> 2.

               <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> will bee friends together to ſupplant Chriſt Ieſus. This is that which <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeakes, The wicked can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abide one an other, &amp;c. but, ſaith hee, then they agree together, when they conſpire to deſtroy the godly, not for that they themſelves love one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for that they both hate him whom they ought to love. But let this bee the comfort of the godly, that their bleſſed Saviour Chriſt Ieſus hath ſtood for their defenſe, and will ſtand for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe for ever. For the whole flock of Chriſt may well ſay, <hi>They have often afflicted me from my youth, oh they have often afflicted mee from my youth; but they

could not prevaile againſt me. The plowers plowed upon my back, and made long furrowes: but the righteous Lord hath cut the cordes of the wicked.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.19.</note> For it is cleerly true, that <hi>many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all: he will not leave them in the hands (of the wicked)</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.33.</note> wholly &amp; altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but will ſo preſerve them, that he wil give them happy deliverances here,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.4.</note> or tranſlate them, where all tears ſhalbe wiped from their eyes, where there ſhal be no more mourning nor lamentation,<note place="margin">1.

If Chriſt be ahungred and ſeeke for fruit from theſe, he ſhall be ſure to finde none at all. Thus wee ſee there be ſome that follow Chriſt, but not willingly, but mercenarily; not willingly but diſſemblingly, for ſhew not for ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, others there bee that follow Chriſt, not willingly but conſtrainedly, as provokt thereunto by the revenging hand of God. This made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to cry out, <hi>The Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 9.27.</note> and to be ſo farre obſequious as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to conſent to let the people goe.

But, as our Saviour himſelfe doth witneſſe, not everie one that ſaith unto him<note n="*" place="margin">That is, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially or conſtrainedly. Mat. 7.21.</note> Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, but he that doth the will of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven. Therefore the true ſheepe

of Chriſt doe follow him willingly, with readie hearts, and inclinde affections to doe whatſoever he injoynes. And thus wee ſee the ſcope of the firſt point, how the ſheepe of Chriſt doe follow him, namely, willingly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they doe follow him patiently, not murmuring, not repining at the afflictions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them in the profeſsion of the Goſpell: for they remember that Chriſt himſelfe doth witneſſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.24.</note> that if any will follow him, they muſt forſake themſelves, and take up their croſſe and follow him: yea, they know that he hath left it as a legacie unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that in him they ſhall have peace,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.33.</note> but in the world affliction. In him a bleſſed peace, the peace of conſcience in this life, and the peace of glorie in the life to come. The incomparable ſolace whereof, is ſo ingraven upon their hearts by the ſpirit of God, that they with cheerfull patience undergoe all the ſtormes that Satan and his confederates can afford,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25, 26</note> 
               <hi>Chooſing rather</hi> (with bleſſed <hi>Moſes) to ſuffer adverſitie, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: eſteeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches than all the treaſures of (the) Epypt (of this world) for they have reſpect unto the recompence of the reward:</hi>

            <p>Therefore the Regenerate once ingraffed into Chriſt by true faith, and his ſpirit,<note place="margin">Iohn 11.25. Iohn 14.6.</note> cannot any more fall away from faith, and from Chriſt.</p>

Rom. 7.15. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the Regenerate ſinne not with full ſwinge of will; for, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>whoſoever is borne of God, ſinneth not,</hi> that is, <hi>ex animo,</hi> or <hi>tota volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> from his heart, or with a full ſwinge of will: for, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, the evill which they do, they allow not, but doe hate it, and are delighted with the law of God according to the inner man: onely in the fleſh, the part corrupt and unregenerate, there dwelleth no good thing; in reſpect thereof they are led captive (that is againſt their wills) unto the law of ſinne.</p>

Secondly, the patience of God in executing revenge upon the wicked. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the equitie of God in puniſhing ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the blindneſſe of man in corrupted nature, from the pluralitie of the ſinnes committed: for the Apoſtle ſaith not, they committed ſome <hi>thing</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, but <hi>things</hi> worthie of death.

            <p>It is a grievous and a miſerable eſtate to commit any thing worthie of death, that is, of eternall death, the due reward of ſinne:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.

For as the ſinne, ſo ſhall be the puniſhment; manie ſinnes, manie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. One ſinne may bring thee to eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but many ſinnes will aggravate the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heape up an increaſe of wrath. We know what the Lord ſpeakes by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 28.17.</note> that hee will lay judgement to the rule: and Chriſt himſelfe tells us, that as Babylon hath ſinned,<note place="margin">Rev. 18.7.</note> ſo ſhee ſhall bee rewarded.

Oh thinke you, if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had truly diſcerned that the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne had multiplyed the judgements of God againſt him,<note place="margin">As we may ſee from Exod. 3. to 14.</note> would hee then ſo often have oppoſed the expreſſe voyce of the Lord?

Or can we thinke, that if that Epicure ſpoken of by our Saviour Chriſt, had truely diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his heape of impieties,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> his pampered fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his unhallowed drunken diſcourſes, his cruell uncharitable affection, that would heare no plaint

nor mourning of poor diſtreſſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that yet did crave but the crummes that fell from his Table: thinke we if hee had truely diſcerned that his foule heape of ſinnes would have brought upon him ſuch a heape of puniſhments, as to force him to cry out for one drop of water, ſuch a drop as might hang but on the tip of a finger;<note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> and that poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould bring it, whom before he held ſo baſe, as not worthy of the crummes that fell from his table; and that to coole but the furie of his tongue onely: a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, only one dip of but the tip of a finger to coole only the raging heat of one ſmall part? oh ſlender eaſe and if it had beene granted: but can we thinke, that if hee had truely underſtood that his ſo great heape of ſinnes would have acquired ſo great a heape of iudgements, that ever he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them? oh void of queſtion hee would not. Or ſhall wee thinke, that if the ungodly creatures of theſe times (that runne headlong the path of ſinne and wickedneſſe) did cleerly ſee their miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, would they then commit ſo many things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of death, to the daily increaſe of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? would they ſo violently reiect all exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all motions of the ſpirit, and ſo furiouſly heape up ſinne upon ſinne, adding not onely rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their ſinnes, but ſtrength to their rebellions? oh void of queſtion they would not. But alas, they are covered over with the darke veyle of ſinne, and corrupted nature, ſo that they doe not truly diſcerne their miſerable eſtates.</p>
            <p>This was the condition of the Gentiles; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they knew in the generall, that they which committed ſuch things were worthy of death, yet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:712:39"/>

From all which, cleerly appeares the veritie of my firſt obſervation, the blindneſſe of man in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature, intimated from the pluralitie of the ſins committed: for in this eſtate hee goes on in ſinne, hee commits things, even many things worthy of death, to heape up judgement, and to aggravate his puniſhment.

            <p>Come I now unto the ſecond point, the patience of God in executing revenge upon the wicked, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in this; that though they commit <hi>things</hi> worthy of death, yet hee forbeares, and doth not preſently throwe them downe to death. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles committed things worthy of death, even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things worthy of death, eternall death; yet God with patience did forbeare, and did not preſently execute upon them the ſtrength of his juſtice, nor caſt upon them his finall wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> when yet as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes, The wages of ſinne is death, even of any ſinne whatſoever.

            </p>
            <p>Come I now unto the forme of their pollution, how they committed theſe things, namely, wilfully &amp; willingly; for, <hi>knowing the juſtice of God,</hi> that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe ſins, yet they committed them. Wherin I conſider, firſt, how God may bee ſaid to be juſt: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what is meant by juſtice in this place.</p>
            <p>For the better opening whereof, conſider we that a thing may be ſaid to be juſt in a three-fold maner;<note place="margin">We are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſts righteouſneſſe, not ſubjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent within us, but relatively and by way of imputation, God in his mercie repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to every beleever, as his owne proper righteouſneſſe; wherfore when the Scriptures in any place expreſſe the Saints of God to be juſt or juſtified, the meaning is not that they have no ſinne, but that it is not imputed: for the materiall or blot of ſinne remaines in ſome meaſure in the beſt of Gods children during their whole life in this world, as the Scriptures plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſe; onely it is taken away in reſpect of the formall thereof, that is, in reſpect of the guilt thereof and the vindictive puniſhment.</note> by Grace, by voluntarie obedience, or by Nature. Firſt by Grace; ſo the Saints and ſervants of God may be ſaid to be iuſt, ſubiectively or inheſively, onely inchoatively, which is their ſanctification; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, imputatively, Chriſts righteouſneſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough faith being reckoned and imputed as theirs, which is their iuſtification. Againe ſecondly, by voluntarie obedience one may be ſaid to be iuſt; ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> iuſt in the ſtate of innocencie; ſo is it moſt truely ſaid of Chriſt, who by his voluntarie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience fulfilled the whole law of God. Thirdly, by nature one may be ſaid to be iuſt, &amp; that eyther as made ſo by the benefite of another, or elſe originally by himſelfe and of his owne nature: in the firſt kinde, it may be truly ſpoken in like manner of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> who was juſt by nature, as being made ſo by the benefit and bountie of his Creator: and moſt truely may it alſo be ſpoken of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, who was conceived in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:712:44"/>
wombe of a virgin, without any ſpot of ſinne by the vertuall operation of the holy Ghoſt. But now concerning God, hee is juſt in a farre different, and farre more excellent manner; for hee is not made juſt, but he is juſt originally of himſelfe and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his eſſence and nature: therefore it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of God, that hee is <hi>ſimpliciter justus,</hi> ſimplie juſt, which cannot be ſaid of any other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for although it may bee ſaid of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that by remiſsion of ſinnes and the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe they are perfectly juſt, yet it is falſe and erroneous to ſay that they are ſimply juſt; nay, Chriſt himſelfe although as hee is man he may be ſaid to be juſt, naturally, habitually, and hypoſtatically, yet ſimply he cannot be ſaid to be, becauſe whatſoever juſtice he hath as he is man, hee hath it by participation from his divine nature. But God is ſo juſt, that hee is his owne juſtice; for juſtice is not in God, as an accident in the ſubject, or by way of compoſition, but of eſſentiall union; for all the proprieties of God are eſſentiall, he is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially juſt, hee is eſſentially good, and therefore juſtice and goodneſſe it ſelfe, and conſequently it is true onely of God, that he is ſimply juſt. This our Saviour Chriſt doth plainely witneſſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.</note> who tells us, <hi>There is none good but God,</hi> that is, ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good, as of himſelfe and by himſelfe, nay, if we ſpeake properly and ſtrictly, none can bee ſaid to be ſo much as perfectly good,<note place="margin">Quod tale eſt ex participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one imperfectè tale eſt.</note> or perfectly juſt, or perfectly holy, neither Angells, nor men; for it is a cleere rule, that that which is ſuch as it is by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, is imperfectly ſuch; as the water, or iron, made hoat by the fire is imperfectly hoat, as having
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:712:44"/>
their heat not naturally, but accidentally and by participation. And thus we ſee how God may bee ſaid to bee juſt, namely, ſimply and abſolutely, in a farre more excellent manner than any other thing whatſoever, as being originally and eſſentially juſt.</p>
            <p>But come wee now to conſider what is meant by juſtice in this place: for although properly there be but one juſtice in God, as there is but one eſſence, yet in regard of the divers reſpects or divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which God in a certaine kinde may bee ſaid to beare, his juſtice alſo may bee ſaid to bee divers. As he is a moſt free Lord doing whatſoever he pleaſeth,<note place="margin">In regard of divers reſpects God may be ſaid to be juſt in a fourefold manner: Vt liber Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, Vt Deus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, Vt Deus &amp; Pater electoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Vt omnium Iudex. As a free Lord, as the God of all, as the God and Father of the elect, as the Iudge of all.</note> his will is his juſtice; as he is the Creator, Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Governour of all things, his goodneſſe is his iuſtice; as hee is a ſpeciall Favourer of the elect, his mercie and his truth in his promiſes, is his iuſtice; as he is the Iudge of all, giving to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes, his due puniſhment of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and abſolving of the innocent, is his iuſtice, which is the iuſtice which is meant in this place; and is called the diſtributive or iudiciarie iuſtice of God, becauſe by it he gives unto every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes. Now obſerve we, this diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or iudiciarie iuſtice of God the heathen knew: and that in a threefold kinde; by the light of nature, by the teſtimony of their owne conſciences, and by the examples of Gods iuſtice in the world.

And concerning this diſtributive or iudiciarie iuſtice (the ſubiect of this diſcourſe) by the light of nature they alſo plainely underſtood it, as amongſt others <hi>Hierocles</hi> doth teſtifie, who ſhewing a reaſon why the ungodly would not have their ſoules to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, ſpeakes after this manner, A wicked man (ſaith he) would not have his ſoule to be immortall, leſt hee ſhould come to the iudge (that is the eternall iudge) there to bee tormented with puniſhments. Yea, hence it was, that <hi>Plato,</hi> a heathen man, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Eliſian fieldes unto them of upright converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, they knew it by the teſtimony of their owne conſciences; for, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, their conſcience did beare them witneſſe, either accuſing

            <p>Thirdly, they knew this diſtributive or iudiciarie iuſtice of God by the examples of Gods iuſtice; for that hath beene true and ſhall bee true for ever which the Lord ſets down by the Prophet <hi>Zephany, Every morning doth hee bring his iudgements to light, and faileth not.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Tull.

that is, of hands: ſo men of ſpiritual ranke, that have power to ordain others, become guilty of their ſinnes, when they promote unworthy perſons unto that ſacred function: therefore that worthy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as a ſerious charge to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Lay hands</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>on no man raſhly;</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, by ſubſcription we come to participate of the ſinnes of others, when we ſubſcribe and ſet our hands to that which is erroneous or evill.

And thus <hi>adiuvando,</hi> by giving any helpe or aſsiſtance unto evill, whether it bee perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, verbally, or manually, we become guilty of that evill.</p>

Thirdly, ſilentially wee become guilty of this ſinne: for there is <hi>conſenſus ſilentii,</hi> a conſent of ſilence; as when we ſee ſinne and ſay nothing of it, which is contrary to Gods iniunction,<note place="margin">Lev. 19.17.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer him to ſin;</hi> and contrary to the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.20.</note>

                  </gap>, It is better to fall among rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Crowes, than among flatterers.</note> the tongues of flatterers doe binde the ſoules of men in ſinne. This was that for which the Lord did cry out againſt the Prophets of Ieruſalem, witneſsing that they did ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked (ſo indulging and flattering them in their ſinnes, that none could returne from their wickedneſſe) for which the Lord doth teſtifie againſt them, that they were to him as Sodom, and as the inhabitants of Gomorrah: for to them that did deſpiſe him, they proclaimed, they ſhould have peace; and to them that walked after the ſtubbornneſſe of their owne hearts, they concluded, no evill ſhould come unto them; ſo flattering them in their evills, that they did binde up their ſoules in ſinne. A ſinne ſo familiar in theſe times, that there is ſcarce anie wickedneſſe ſo great, or errour ſo odious, but it findes ſome Paraſite or other to flatter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge it: but he, ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi>

            <p>Hence it is, that in the ſeventh of his Hiſtorie he compares the life of man to a hireling:<note place="margin">Iob 7.1.</note> and in the foureteenth,<note place="margin">Iob 14.2.</note> unto a flower and a ſhadow, which doe ſoone paſſe away, and is of no continuance.

               <hi>Cry, &amp;c. that all fleſh is graſſe, and all the glorie thereof, as the flower of the field.</hi> So that we ſee it cleer, that the ſtate of man in reſpect of his naturall life, may well bee ſaid to bee as a ſwift Race, that ſoone ſpeedes unto an end. Which might well ſerve as a caution to the ſecure Nabals of theſe times, to whom it is common with greedy purſuit to proſecute the world,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Againe, if we conſider the ſtate of man, as for his naturall life, ſo alſo for his corrupted nature, it may fitly be compared unto a Race; for, how prone are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:712:61"/>
men, cloathed with the cloudes of vicious nature, to proſecute ſinne? oh, how ſwift are the ungodly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evill? how ſpeedy are they in this Race? when any are about any thing that is good, oh, how long are they in determination? how ſlowly doe they bring it into action? We ſee in divers it is long before they have ſo much as a determination to leave ſin, but when doe they proceed to practiſe? oh, how ſlow are they in this kinde? Wee may often heare the ungodly ſay, when God doth execute ſome ſtroke of iuſtice upon them, Oh, if we be delivered from this deſtreſſe, wee will never doe as we have done: but wee have ſeene it fare with divers of theſe, even as it did with obdurate <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>

Such ſteps may we ſometime behold in ungodly perſons, ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to leave ſinne, but how intolerably ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe they bring forth the practiſe thereof? So that we may ſee it cleer, it is a long time in divers before they determine any thing that is good, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from determination to practice, oh, how rare are they in this kinde?</p>
            <p>But in the caſe of ſinne and wickedneſſe, we may ſee it farre otherwiſe.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.8.</note>

               <note place="margin">Marke 6.19.24</note> and ſhe was ſwift to put it in action, preferring her determined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, before the halfe of a Kingdome. Yea the bleſſed Evangeliſt doth witneſſe unto us, that when the wicked and bloudy Iewes had got the Coate of Chriſt into their hands,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.23, 24.</note> they ſpeedily determined what they would doe with it, and preſently they put it in practice, they caſt lots for it: but oh that the Coate of the righteous ſhould ever come into the hands of the wicked! But here wee may ſee it cleere, that the ungodly are ſpeedy in the courſe of miſchiefe. This <hi>Salomon</hi> doth plainely confirme, <hi>Their feet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth runne to evill:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1.16.</note>

               <hi>and aſſoone as the morning yeelds light, they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it,</hi> ſpeedy in the determination, ſpeedy in the execution of evill. Oh, how great experience have we hereof in theſe our corrupted times? wherin we may behold many not onely, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes, to draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie, and ſin as it were with cart ropes,<note place="margin">Eſay 5.18.</note> or, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, to drinke it in like water;<note place="margin">Iob 15.16.</note> but to runne the Race of ſinne like ſpeedy feeted <hi>Nimſhi's,</hi> caſting away all feare of God, all regard of his worſhip, all reſpect of his ſacred word, never fixing an eye upon it, but when they make it a cloke for their baſe deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But let theſe know that are ſo ſwift in the courſe of evill, that, that ſhall bee true of them for ever, that the holy Ghoſt ſets downe of them by <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Iobs</hi> Hiſtorie,<note place="margin">Iob 20.12. &amp;c.</note> When wickedneſſe is ſweet in the mouth of the wicked, when (they) hide it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their tongues, when (they) favour it, and will

not forſake it, but keepe it cloſe in (their) mouthes, then ſhall the meate in their bowells bee turned, and the gall of Aſpes ſhall be in the midſt of them, and the ſubſtance they have devoured, they ſhall vomit it, God ſhall draw it out of their bellies. Thus wee ſee it cleere, that the ſtate of man may well be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered by a Race, whether wee reſpect quantitie or qualitie, his naturall life or his corrupted nature. And thus much for the word <hi>Runne,</hi> in the Abſtract, as it ſimply impies a Race.</p>
            <p>Come we now to conſider it in the Contret, with the coherence of the Text, as it implies a certaine ſpeciall kinde of Race. And becauſe in every Race two things are ſpecially remarkable, the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the place from which, and the place to which wee bend our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: conſider wee therefore, here in this ſpirituall Race, the thing from which wee are to runne, and the thing to which we are to ſpeed our courſe. And obſerve we, That that from which wee are to bend our paſſage, is the loathſome ſink of ſin, our heape of foule corruptions. And this for ſpeciall reaſon: for, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Eſay 59.2.</note> ſinne makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorſe between God and us, <hi>Your iniquities</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have ſeparated betweene you and your God, and have cauſed him to hide his face from you.</hi> Sinne, oh tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in Gods ſight; for, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.5.</note>

And this alſo moſt iuſtly: for, what can be more equall, than that there ſhould bee an eternall and an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impoſed upon that which carries with it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of infinitie?
